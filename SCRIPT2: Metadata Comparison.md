# Script 2: Metadata Comparison Script

## Overview

This Python script allows you to compare metadata between two Salesforce orgs by analyzing two XML packages. It identifies the differences in metadata members and generates a detailed Excel report outlining what is missing in the package being compared.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Usage

1. **Close Excel File:**
   Before launching the script, ensure that any existing Excel file generated by the script is closed.

2. **Package to be Compared:**
   The package to be compared should have more metadata than the comparing package, and the script checks for missing components.

3. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python3 ComparePackagesXML.py
   ```

   Input Package Paths:
   - Enter the path of the package to be compared (generally ROW) when prompted.
   - Enter the path of the comparing package (generally SFOA).

4. **Review Excel Report:**
   Open the generated Excel file named `CompareXML.xlsx` on your desktop. The report provides a comprehensive overview of metadata members, their types, SFOA status, and deployment status.

## Configuration

- The script includes a list of metadata members to exclude (`membersToRemove`). Modify this list based on your specific requirements.

## Notes

- The script compares the SFOA status with the SFOA package to determine deployment status.
  - **Additional Note:**
    - For each metadata member in the comparing package (ROW), the script checks if it is present in the SFOA package. The result is recorded in the "SFOA package" column as either "In Package" or "Not in Package."
  - **Deployment Status:**
    - `OK`: The metadata member is expected and in the SFOA package.
    - `NOT OK`: The metadata member is either missing or not supported as per SFOA.
