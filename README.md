# Metadata Audit Script

## Overview

This Python script is designed to perform an audit of metadata within an XML file. It analyzes the provided XML file, extracts relevant information, and generates an Excel report with details on the data types and their status in the context of SFOA (Salesforce Objects Architecture).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Usage

### Close Excel File

Before launching the script, ensure that any existing Excel file generated by the script is closed.

### Copy the path of the package (Package XML)

Right-click in VS Code and "Copy path."

### Run the Script

Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 createExcelFromPackageXML.py
```

### Input XML File

Enter the path of the XML file when prompted.

### Output Excel File

The script will generate an Excel file named `Audit.xlsx` on your desktop. If the file already exists, a new sheet with a timestamp will be added.

### Review Report

Open the generated Excel file to review the audit report. The report includes information about metadata members, their types, and their SFOA status.

## Configuration

- The script includes a list of metadata members to exclude (`membersToRemove`). Modify this list based on your specific requirements.

## Notes

- The status for each metadata member is determined based on predefined rules.
  - `Expected OK`: The metadata member is supported in SFOA.
  - `Not supported in SFOA`: The metadata member is not supported in SFOA.
  - `Data Scope`: Applicable only for `EmailTemplate` type.
  - `Scope To Define`: Applicable for `Report` and `Dashboard` types.
